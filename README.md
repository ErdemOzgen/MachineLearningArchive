# Install Jupyter-Notebook Dark theme

This my personal preference, you can skip this if you want.

- `conda install -c conda-forge jupyterthemes`
- `pip install jupyterthemes`
- `jt -l`
- ` jt -t chesterish`


Also run this command for debugs:

- ` #for debug purpose ` 
- ` %qtconsole --style solarized-dark `
